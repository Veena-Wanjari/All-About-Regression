MSE & Linear Regression

Here, we have four files:

1) Height_Weight_1.csv : contains only the five rows with height and weight details.

2) Height_Weight.csv : contain 35 rows with the details of height and weight of different people.

3) MSE(Mean squared error): this notebook consists of 
 * basic calculation of MSE using statistical approach.
 * MSE calculations using numpy.
 * MSE calculations using scikit-learn.

4) Simple-Linear-Regression: this notebook consists of
 * Considering height as an independent variable and weight as dependent variable.
 * Predicting weight of a given person for a given height.
 * Solving with statistical approach
 * Solving with pythonic way.
